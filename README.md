## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Webpack

This website is a single page application that was made with the theme of a restaurant in mind. It uses different Javascript
files to dynamically render each pages' content from each imported javascript module. The big idea of this project was to learn about using the JS Module Pattern for writing your code. The project involves a LOT of DOM manipulation including element creation and event listeners. After all is said and done the website is then bundled through Webpack.

## Lessons Learned:

- The JS Module Pattern taught me the principles of public and private code.
- I really like mahogany colors for CSS.
- Learning to configure Webpack made me delve through a lot of documentation.
- Single Page Applications aren't that scary to build.
